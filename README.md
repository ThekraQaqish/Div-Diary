#  Hi, I’m Thekra QaQish

I’m a passionate **JavaScript developer** focused on building **responsive**, **accessible**, and **efficient web applications**. I love writing clean code, solving real-world problems, and continuously improving both my technical and soft skills.

## Developer Mindset

Based on [Bomberbot’s article](https://www.bomberbot.com/software-development/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes/), a great developer mindset means:

- Staying **curious** and always willing to learn
- Viewing challenges as **growth opportunities**
- Writing code that is **clean**, **readable**, and **maintainable**
- **Collaborating** and **communicating** effectively in teams

>  A strong mindset is just as important as strong code.

##  Markdown Essentials

Thanks to the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), I use Markdown to write clean, readable documentation. Here’s what I often use:

- `#` Headings
- `*italic*` and `**bold**` text
- `[Link](url)` and `![Image](url)`
- Lists: `- Bullet` or `1. Numbered`
- Code: `inline` or blocks with triple backticks
- `> Blockquotes`

>  Markdown makes documentation simple and developer-friendly.

##  Command Line Navigation

I learned core terminal skills from [Codecademy’s CLI Cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation/cheatsheet):

| Command  | Use                                |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| `pwd`    | Show current directory             |
| `ls`     | List contents of a directory       |
| `cd`     | Change directory                   |
| `mkdir`  | Create a new folder                |
| `touch`  | Create a new file                  |

>  Mastering the terminal is key to becoming an efficient developer.
